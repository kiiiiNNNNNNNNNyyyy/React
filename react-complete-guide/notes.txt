In react, we should key to the properties to keep track of the individual elments to find out which element changed and which didn't. 

// Disadvantages of using inline styling in react.
* You cannot use pseudo selectors.

Stateless vs Stateful components

Stateful (containers) 
class XY extends Component
We can access state
We can implement lifecycle hooks 
Only use stateful if you need to manage State or access to the lifecycle hooks.

Stateless
They are functions that receive state as props.
They dont have access to Stateful.
They cannot implement lifecycle hooks.
Use in all other cases.

Component Liecycle
Only available in Stateful Components.
    - Some functions that come with this are the following
        * contructor.
        * componentsWillMount()
        * componentsWillUpdate()
        * render()
        Only contructor(), componentWillMount(), componentDidMount() and render() are executed during creation

The order in which the lifecycle methods are executed is
* contructor();
* componentsWillMount()
* render()
* Render child components.

Component lifecycle of Updating - Steps
* componentsWillReceiveProps(nextProps) -   Sync states to props
* shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - May cancel updating components.
* componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) - if you say yes to the above steps
* render()
* Update child components
* componentDidUpdate();

Component Lifecycle - update (Triggered by internal change)
* shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
* componentsWillUpdate()
* render()
* Update Child components props
* componentDidUpdate()
